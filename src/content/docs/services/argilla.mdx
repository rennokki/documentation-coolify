## What is Argilla?

Argilla is a collaboration tool for AI engineers and domain experts who need to build high-quality datasets for their projects.

## Why use Argilla?

Argilla can be used for collecting human feedback for a wide variety of AI projects like traditional NLP (text classification, NER, etc.), LLMs (RAG, preference tuning, etc.), or multimodal models (text to image, etc.).

Argilla's programmatic approach lets you build workflows for continuous evaluation and model improvement. The goal of Argilla is to ensure your data work pays off by quickly iterating on the right data and models.

### Improve your AI output quality through data quality

Compute is expensive and output quality is important. We help you focus on data, which tackles the root cause of both of these problems at once. Argilla helps you to achieve and keep high-quality standards for your data. This means you can improve the quality of your AI outputs.

### Take control of your data and models

Most AI tools are black boxes. Argilla is different. We believe that you should be the owner of both your data and your models. That's why we provide you with all the tools your team needs to manage your data and models in a way that suits you best.

### Improve efficiency by quickly iterating on the right data and models

Gathering data is a time-consuming process. Argilla helps by providing a tool that allows you to interact with your data in a more engaging way. This means you can quickly and easily label your data with filters, AI feedback suggestions and semantic search. So you can focus on training your models and monitoring their performance.
